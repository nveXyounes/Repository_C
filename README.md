# Overview



# What is a combo?

A combo list is a text file containing a list of emails/usernames and passwords in a consistent format. Combolists are meant to be machine-readable so they can be used as input to tools that will automate authentication requests to a website or API. A common example would be credential stuffing attacks. The most common formats of combo list are given below.

A proxy server acts as a gateway between you and the internet. It’s an intermediary server separating end users from the websites they browse.

There are different type of proxies but most commonly used proxies types are HTTP, SOCKS4 and SOCKS5.

# How to crack accounts?

This is the main part of cracking. In this part, you use different tools to crack accounts of different sites. There are a lot of tools available on Internet but I’m going to suggest you a few tools that every cracker must-have:
1. Openbullet: Configurable Checker
2. Storm: Cracking Program
3. Spotify Checkers
4. Netflix Checkers
5. VPN Checkers
6. Combolists
 These are the mainly tools which you want in cracking..

I think that’s enough tool for beginners to start cracking. Also, use these tools on RDP/VPS because some of these tools contain a virus that can harm your computer. If you want to purchase RDP/VPS then mail me on anonymoush4kr.z@gmail.com

# How to use a checker?

Mostly all checkers have the same interface like a button to load your combo and a button to load your proxies if checker required proxies. Then select the proxy type which type of proxies are you using. After that select the number of threads depending upon your computer and internet speed. At the end click the start button to start the cracking and you will find your good accounts in the capture section.
